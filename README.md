This lab simulates a realistic Kafka streaming pipeline where students must **clean and validate streaming JSON data**.



## TO DO
Your consumer must:

Parse JSON safely

Validate schema and data types

Detect invalid records

Route records to the appropriate Kafka topic

## Constraints

You must not modify the producer

You must not modify the input files

Your consumer must not crash on bad data
